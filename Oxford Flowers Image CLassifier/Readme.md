# Image Classifer

This project involves classification of " Oxford Flowers 102 " dataset and predicting top 5 probable flower names for the images in test .
The results in the paper are produced on a 103 category database. The two
categories labeled Petunia have since been merged since they are the same.
There is a training file (trnid), a validation file (valid)
and a testfile (tstid).
